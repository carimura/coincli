# CoinCLI

This is a simple CLI tool that gets cryptocurrency prices from
CoinMarketCap. It's written in Java and compiled ahead-of-time into 
an executable (as CLI's should be) using GraalVM's native image stuff.

You probably don't want to use this to perform technical analysis. Or at all. 
It's pretty dumb in its current state and probably always will be. 
But if you want to contribute, keep reading.

# Contributing

## Pre-Requisites

- [GraalVM CE 19](https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases)
- Native Image: `gu install native-image` (see [here](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/))

## Building

1. `mvn clean build`
2. https://medium.com/graalvm/introducing-the-tracing-agent-simplifying-graalvm-native-image-configuration-c3b56c486271
2. `native-image -jar target/coincli-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar coincli`

## TODO

- include everything inside the executable for portability (i guess this ins't the default?)
- when supplying both a `--num` and `--up/down`, should return the number not the filtered number (or rename to max num to eliminate confusion)
- specific coin should hit a different API to get just that coin.
- ability to specify time range (not just 7 days hardcoded)
