# CoinCLI

This is a simple CLI tool that gets cryptocurrency prices from
CoinMarketCap. It's written in Java and compiled ahead-of-time into 
an executable (as CLI's should be) using GraalVM's native-image stuff.

You probably don't want to use this to become a day trader. 
Or at all really. But here it is.

# Building

1. `mvn clean build`
2. `native-image -jar target/coincli-0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar coincli`
