# CoinCLI

This is a simple CLI tool that gets cryptocurrency prices from
CoinMarketCap. It's written in Java and compiled ahead-of-time into 
an executable (as CLI's should be) using GraalVM's native-image stuff.

You probably don't want to use this to perform technical analysis. 
Or at all really. But here it is.
